CitationManager
===============

A citation manager Agave (app for Office) for Word 2013 rich client with Google Scholar support.

Feature:
* Create citations.
* Import citation from Google Scholar.
* Insert the citation to the ducument.
* Generate the reference table.

This is a solo-project for ODP Hackathon in December 2014. The goal is to utilize Apps for Office API to create productive app.

Google Scholar doesn't provide any API yet. Therefore a 3rd party parser is used to analyze the results. To get the Google Scholar Parser, please visit this project:
